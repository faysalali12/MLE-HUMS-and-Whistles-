(i) Formulate a machine learning problem that can be attempted using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset and build a solution model.

The two sets of files used for the basic solution of this project contained a small section of audio from the theme songs of Harry Potter and Starwars.

In order for the model to function without any errors or have data missing, the raw data was cleaned and the file names were corrected. The dataset that was used was part 1 folders for both Potter and StarWars. The overall dataset that was used for this model included 416 audio files. Each of the files followed a certain structure when it came to file_id and Interpretation number, which allowed a dataframe to be created using the audio files.
