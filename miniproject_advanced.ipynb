(i) Formulate a machine learning problem that can be attempted using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset and build a solution model. (ii) Create a product that uses the functionality provided by a model trained on the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset (e.g. a simple App that predicts the label Harry or StarWars when you hum to it).  \n","\n","The submission will consist of two Jupyter notebooks, one for the basic solution and another one for advanced solution.

The two sets of files used for the basic solution of this project contained a small section of audio from the theme songs of The Great Showman and Mamma Mia.

In order for the model to function without any errors or have data missing, the raw data was cleaned and the file names were corrected. The dataset that was used was part 1 folders for both Showman and Mamma. The overall dataset that was used for this model included 428 audio files. Each of the files followed a certain structure when it came to file_id and Interpretation number, which allowed a dataframe to be created using the audio files.
